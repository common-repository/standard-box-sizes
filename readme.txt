== Description ==

The Standard Box Sizes plugin is designed exclusively for use with Eniture Technology’s Small Package Quotes plugins.  The plugin allows merchants to record standard box sizes which are subsequently used to identify a packaging solution prior to obtaining shipping rate estimates.  The packaging solution is saved with orders as a step-by-step graphical illustration that the merchant can refer to during fulfillment.  The result is the most accurate shipping rate estimates possible.  The Small Package Quotes plugin is available for FedEx, Purolator, UPS, and UPS reseller Worldwide Express.
